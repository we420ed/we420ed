# 🌿 we420ed – The Official Blockchain for Weed Coin (4:20)

**we420ed** is a custom blockchain built for the Weed Coin (4:20) ecosystem — a decentralized, cannabis-inspired crypto project designed to empower weed lovers, stoners, and the global cannabis community.

This blockchain is built using **Substrate** and powers the minting, earning, and participation logic of the WEED (420) coin. With a unique daily minting system (at 4:20 AM & PM UTC), users earn just by interacting with the ecosystem. It's more than crypto — it's a lifestyle.
